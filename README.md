Heart Disease Prediction Model

Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction Model project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various clinical parameters such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. By using machine learning techniques, this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and optimized use of medical resources.

Key Steps

- Data Collection: Sourced a dataset containing clinical parameters and heart disease indicators.
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to prepare the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data distributions and relationships between variables to gain insights.
- Feature Selection: Identified significant features using correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.
- Model Development: Implemented machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting using scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance the model's accuracy.

Business Value
